    <div class="content">Liu Ren is a note in the traditional Chinese calendar, used to mark the daily auspiciousness. 
        It is a method of using the six lines of the eight trigrams to make predictions based on the current time.
        There are six outcomes listed on the index finger, middle finger and ring finger respectively: <span style="color: brown;">Da'an(大安), Liulian(留连), Suxi(速喜), Chikou(赤口), Xiaoji(小吉) and Kongwang(空亡)</span>.<br>
